# Quantum-ML-Project-Work
This project serves as the final examination for the Quantum Machine Learning module. The goal is to apply concepts learned throughout the course to solve real-world problems using quantum computing techniques. 

## Abstract

 In this report, we explored the application of convolutional neu
ral networks (CNNs) and hybrid neural networks (HNNs) for
 binary classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. We con
ducted three experiments, each focusing on distinguishing be
tween different pairs of classes: airplane vs. automobile, cat vs.
 dog, and ship vs. truck. For each experiment, we trained both
 CNN and HNN models, analyzing their performance in terms
 of overall accuracy and class-wise accuracy. Results indicate
 that while both models demonstrate competitive performance,
 HNNs exhibit advantages in certain aspects, suggesting their
 potential superiority in specific scenarios.
